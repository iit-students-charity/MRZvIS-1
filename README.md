# MRZvIS
There are MRZvIS's labs

For the first lab is not completely my code, I found a lot of on academic department's local repos and create this. If you find here your code, please, connect to me, I'll remove it.

You can find reports for [fitst](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbBO7BwhFsWrzQY9fC_py03XnDk4Y6vCmiXo7smSTf4/edit) and [second](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRA0rU-DKcmTw19Pwu8cDG1qRVfxIgpXw_lWRT_ApUs/edit) labs.
